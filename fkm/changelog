- Merged latest ALS.
- Disallowed taking down cores 4-7 completely (big and prime).
- Reverted some commits that caused panics.
- Some scheduler and tcp improvements.
- Latest upstream and CAF tags merged.
- Fixed dt2w on AOSPA.
- Charger improvements/fixes.
- Renamed the OLDFOD into LOSFOD to avoid confusion.

Standalone versions will ship embedded dtbo from now on,
which means that it will completely ignore dtbo that you flashed.

Version that will ship in ROMs will accept custom dtbos and screen OC
should work fine now.
